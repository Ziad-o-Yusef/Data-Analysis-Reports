# Open Source Data Project

This repository contains visualizations of various data sets sourced from open data sources on the internet. The reports found here were part of a Machinfy course for (Professional Data Analysis). Work was done on different platforms for data visualization, analysis and reporting such as (Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio from Google).

## Project Goal

* Visualize various data sets from open data sources on the internet in different ways using data analysis tools.
* Share reports and analyses that were completed during the "Machine Learning" course (Professional Data Analysis).
* Highlight the capabilities of different data analysis tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Looker Studio from Google in data visualization and analysis.

## Content

* Data will be displayed from various sources such as:
    * Government data
    * Medical data
    * Data from international organizations
    * Social media platform data
    * Data from other websites

* The following data analysis tools will be used to visualize and analyze the data:
    * Power BI
    * Tableau
    * Looker Studio from Google

* Reports and analyses that have been completed will be shared in the form of PDF files or images.

## Benefits

* Learn about the open data sources available on the internet.
* Learn how to use different data analysis tools to visualize and analyze data.
* See reports and analyses that have been completed using open data sources.

## Notes

* This project is still under development.
* More data and analysis will be added over time.
* We welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve this project.
